								<h3>Soundscape</h3>
								<p> For the first project project, we were tasked with creating a soundscape narrative, creating a sense of <em> place </em> and <em> story </em> using only sound as a medium. Layering was especially important, so we utilized Audacity to be able to easily visualize, arrange, and edit different sound layers simultaneously. </p>
								<p> The title of this project is "Acting Like a Child". Below is the content of the README file. You can access the rest of the information and details or simply listen to the soundscape mp3 itself below! <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/soundscape--christyh310">here</a> </p>

							<h4> Acting Like a Child </h4> </br>

								<p> As I started this project, I knew that I wanted to use a poem that I wrote, called “Acting Like a Child”, and set my soundscape at a playground to remind listeners of the days of blissful recess times of playing tag in mulch and jump-roping, and to contrast this childhood scene with the way that we view children as we ourselves mature.

								</br> I hope that as you listen to my soundscape - the responses of people, the yelling and laughter of children, other typical playground sounds, and then the verses of my poem - that you consider your own opinions on children, and how, perhaps, being childlike may not be the opposite of being worthy, dignified, and valuable.

								</br> Where can you find more information? How do you listen to the Soundscape?

								</br>
								To understand a bit more of the process of making the soundscape, and the reasoning behind the sounds or layering of them, see reflection.md.

								</br>
								For instructions on how to listen to the soundscape (especially if you're unfamiliar with git or github), go to the ABOUT.md file.

								</br>The soundscape itself was made using Audacity, and the project file from there is called Acting_like_a_child_project.aup.

							<h4> Visual Rhetoric </h4>
							<p> For the second project, we created visual rhetoric pieces, aiming to make a point, and elicit a
								 response from the desired audience, using the affordances of visual media as a medium, applying contrast,
								 negative space, flow, and other properties. Below is the content of the README file. You can access the rest of the
								 information and the visual rhetoric project itself <a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/visual-rhetoric--christyh310">here</a> </p>

							<h4> Assimilation is not part of the puzzle </h4>
               <p> Thank you for taking time to look at my visual rhetoric project. The title of this project is “Assimilation is not part of the Puzzle.”
								 I made this project to evoke consideration on your part, particularly consideration for the people and place of the
								 Yakama Nation in Washington. I hope you can see the dignity, distinction, and innate worth of the native people
								 and their culture. I am also arguing that there are many pieces of the puzzle that need to be taken to
								 mend the many years and layers of cultural and physical damage that has been done to native America,
								 but that assimilation isn’t even close to being one of those pieces. </br>
