												<h2> Snow, but still dry</h2>
												<p> For the past month or so, it has snowed multiple feet in Yakama. Our work, and the after-school club that
												we went to with the kids on the reservation looked different because of this. However, this snow-covered place
												is usually extraordinarily dry both physically and relationally. So, one of the main parts of Scripture that Sacred
											Road often refers to is Isaiah 58. (write it here) To be an oasis in a desert land is to rely on the Lord to fill us up,
										and only then will be able to pour out and love our first neighbors well. </p>

												<h2> Loving people like Family </h2>
												On the Yakama reservation, and on several Native American reservations, there is much relational brokenness.
												Therefore, different worksite activities that one-week teams do can fill familial/relational roles: for example, by chopping firewood for
												an elder, we can fill the role of their children or grandchildren. By painting or repairing a home for a family, we can do the same. By giving piggy back rides, doing crafts,
												and playing jumprope with younger kids, we can fill the older sibling or parental role that may be missing in their lives.

												<h2> Making low the Mountains, so ALL people can see together </h2>
												Isaiah 40 has been a passage I've dwelt upon often this semester. When I was in Yakama last week,
												it came to mind again, particularly verses 4 and 5:
											 "Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain shall become level, the rugged places a plain. And the glory
												  of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together,
													for the mouth of the Lord has spoken." (Isaiah 40:4-5)

												<h2> Journal Entry </h2>
													<p>	Isaih 40 is particularly relevant in the context of native america because the Lord seeks to reveal himself to <em> all </em> people. He doesn't
															chose one type of person and I think this is sometimes forgotten in mainstream America, which is tragic. Because, truthfully, the gospel (the truth that the Bible states, where Jesus came and lived and died for us so we could have relationship with God)
															is true for all nations, all people, for all time. And that's beautiful.
															In my journal, I wrote: </p>

															<p> Lord, reading Isaiah 40 makes me think of Sam. Sam, who can't see over the seats of the bus yet, Sam who has the same set of clothes and hat for every kid's club, who hast eh most beautiful round, discerning and yet completely unassuming
															eyes. Sam, who isn't get 4 or 5 but who knows how to say "shut up" to her brothers and how to hit to defend herslef. Sam, who hasn't had her face cleaned or nose wiped in days. Sam is yours, Lord. But, she doesn't know you. She doesn't receive love well, mostly Because
															she may not receive it often enough. I pray that you would <em> level the mountains </em> and <em> make low the hills </em>, so she can see over the seat fo teh bus, over the hills around yakama valley, over the mistreatment or non-treatment she's experienced,
															over the ravaging of her community and destruction of her childhood.. over it all, that she would see You and know Your love for her.</p>
