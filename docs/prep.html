    <div class='text'> Devotionals

      <p> In order to help prepare our hearts and minds for the spring break mission trip(s), and to better understand God's love
        for the people that we want to serve and understand better, Sacred Road Ministries has us do devotionals. I wanted to briefly discuss
        how helpful these Biblical devotionals are in the week prior and the week during the trip. </p>

<!--probably should put this disclaimer on all pages, and probably before any other text-->
        <p>Fair warning, I'm a Christian, and so I'll be talking about my faith in God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit,
          and how I've seen God at work in my life. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
          I'm am also <em> not </em> trying to single out a particular ministry that is caring for Native people, because there are
          several people, both native and not, who are walking toward reconciliation between native and mainstream america, and who have a heart
          for seeing the native church become a part of the church as a whole. I'm simply talking about my personal experience and understanding.
          I'm not claiming to be wise or knowledgable, but I do want to share what I've experienced. </p>

      <p> I'll be honest, in that most days, especially those before spring break, my mind is scattered, and I'm quite weak in body and spirit.
          With all of the exams and assignments thrown at us in the weeks leading up to spring break, finding rest in His word and in music
          that reminds me of His goodness and grace </p>
