# Project 3: Website Portfolio

Hello! Our task in this unit is to **build a responsive website using basic html and css files** with multiple interlinking files, and understanding the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities.

Where is the information that we need?

CREDITS.md: to give credit to the template I used, per CC BY 3 license

"":01-10, and “walking-toward-reconciliation” are completion of tutorials, and beginnings of website development without template
REFLECTION.md: description of the process of creating this website

Html5up-spectral.zip: folder where all the template files were stored before I moved and modified them

CNH_modified_html5up-spectral: location of all the files you need to download and use to view my website
